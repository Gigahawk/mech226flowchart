Write a set of instructions and produce a flow chart on a topic of your choice. Assume your audience is the general public.

Your INSTRUCTIONS must include the following:
- Equipment/supplies list with at least 1 item
- A minimum of 10 steps
- A minimum of 5 visuals
- At least 1 note and 1 warning/caution

You will also be evaluated on the following:
- Does the document answer the questions: Why am I doing this? How do I do it? What will I need? and What could go wrong?
- Does it use an Intro-Body-Conclusion format (and use it properly)?
- Is it a usable document for the specified audience?
- Are steps easy to understand without being patronizing? Do they use the active and imperative voice?
- Are visuals and hazard notices used properly?
- Do the instructions meet professional standards for spelling and grammar?
- Is the document formatted correctly and does it look professional?

Your FLOWCHART must include the following:
- A minimum of 10 action blocks
- A minimum of 2 decision points, of which at least one must be a “loop”

You will also be evaluated on the following:
- Does the flow chart support the written instructions?
- Is it neat and clear?
- It is presented either top-to-bottom or left-to-right?
- Are appropriate symbols used?
- Does each block only contain one action or decision?
